# E-HEALTH-CARE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-PROJECT
It is a desktop application that is used in hospitals to help in registering patients and giving them a unique number that they use to identify them.
When you have the unique number or the identification number, you do not have to register again in any hospital because the ID includes your health records, which have all your history
